By the proposed pharmacy management system, our team intends to overcome the efficiency, security and reliability issues of the current manual system 
and in turn improving the overall productivity of the pharmacy. 

Following is a brief interpretation of the proposed solution outline for the prevailing issues in the current system. 

1. Implementation of a sub function to manage the drug inventory, including drug database handling and drug expiration management.
2. Implementation of a sub function to manage the prescriptions in a proper manner.
3. Implementation of varying access levels with a proper user management system.
4. Facilitation of report generation based on user requirements.
